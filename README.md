# A Review of the Current Antimalarial Pipeline

This Open Source Malaria repository is a review of medicines for malaria, their past, present and future.

The review exists on the "Wiki" tab, above. Discussion about the review (things that can be added or changes, or things that need doing) happens in the "Issues" tab, above. 

The review is _living_, meaning it can be incrementally edited and expanded by anyone. The starting point is [an original, peer-reviewed article published in 2019 in Malaria Journal](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-019-2724-z) (The Past, Present and Future of Anti-malarial Medicines, Edwin G. Tse, Marat Korsik and Matthew H. Todd, _Malaria J_. *2019*, 18:93 (DOI: 10.1186/s12936-019-2724-z)). Once the review has been substantially edited and updated it is possible we can seek to publish an update of this type, e.g. annually. This formally published article ought to be the thing that is cited, at least for the moment.

All the files used in the original review are available in this repository (click the "code" tab above if you get lost on another page). If you update a file, share the updated file in the right place with a meaningful file name. The best way to see how to contribute to the wiki is to click on "edit" on any given page to see how the page is put together.

If you've questions, please raise an Issue (tab, above). If you think you need editing privileges ping an existing member of this repository or someone from OSM (e.g. mattodd or edwintse). General informal inquiries are best on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/O_S_M). Email contact is possible (opensourcemalaria@gmail.com), but is not great because others cannot then see what is being discussed.
