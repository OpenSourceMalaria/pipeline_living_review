  abstract        = {A combination of atovaquone and proguanil has been found to be quite effective in treating malaria, with little evidence of the emergence of resistance when atovaquone was used as a single agent. We have examined possible mechanisms for the synergy between these two drugs. While proguanil by itself had no effect on electron transport or mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), it significantly enhanced the ability of atovaquone to collapse DeltaPsim when used in combination. This enhancement was observed at pharmacologically achievable doses. Proguanil acted as a biguanide rather than as its metabolite cycloguanil (a parasite dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] inhibitor) to enhance the atovaquone effect; another DHFR inhibitor, pyrimethamine, also had no enhancing effect. Proguanil-mediated enhancement was specific for atovaquone, since the effects of other mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors, such as myxothiazole and antimycin, were not altered by inclusion of proguanil. Surprisingly, proguanil did not enhance the ability of atovaquone to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport in malaria parasites. These results suggest that proguanil in its prodrug form acts in synergy with atovaquone by lowering the effective concentration at which atovaquone collapses DeltaPsim in malaria parasites. This could explain the paradoxical success of the atovaquone-proguanil combination even in regions where proguanil alone is ineffective due to resistance. The results also suggest that the atovaquone-proguanil combination may act as a site-specific uncoupler of parasite mitochondria in a selective manner.},

  abstract        = {Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia is highly resistant to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine. Quinine-tetracycline has been used as a second line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but duration of treatment varies from place to place. The 7-days course of this combination has been shown to be very effective. However, due to the cinchonism adverse effects, the patient compliance has not been satisfactory. We have evaluated the efficacy of a 7-days course of tetracycline in combination with either 5 or 7-days course of quinine. Ninety male Thai patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases were randomized to receive tetracycline 250 mg qid for 7 days in combination with either quinine 600 mg tid for 5 days (Q5T7; group A) or quinine 600 mg tid for 7 days (Q7T7; group B). The patients were hospitalized for 28 days. Patients in both groups had a comparable initial response to treatment, with the clearance of fever and parasites within 4 days. There were 46 and 40 patients in group A and B, respectively, who completed the 28 day of follow-up. The cure rates were 87 and 100%, respectively for group A and B. No serious adverse effects were found in either group; transient nausea, vomiting and tinnitus were common findings. The incidence of adverse effects was not different between the two groups. The results from the present study suggest that a short course treatment of quinine (Q5T7) had significantly decreased the cure rate. In areas with quinine resistant falciparum malaria, a full course of 7-days quinine, in combination with 7-days course of tetracycline is recommended for hospital treatment. However, an alternative shorter course of antimalarials is suggested for home treatment.},

  abstract        = {The sensitivity to chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from 3 areas of southwest Cameroon was evaluated using an in vitro microtest with estimation of parasite growth by 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation. Among 2,429 children examined, P. falciparum was found on thin smears in 124 of them, 76 isolates were submitted to in vitro tests and 72 were successful. In the locations studied, some of which are close to the area of Limbe where in vivo resistance has been reported, all 72 isolates were found fully sensitive to low concentrations of chloroquine (mean EC50 5.9 ng/ml or 18.5 nmol/l of medium). In 47 of these isolates simultaneously tested using WHO microtest predosed plates, the sensitivity was identical. Out of 39 tests performed with quinine, 35 were successful. While most strains responded to low concentrations, some showed a decreased sensitivity to the drug, the EC50 of 4 of them being in the range 230-300 nmol/l. Each of the 17 isolates tested with mefloquine was susceptible to very low concentrations of freshly prepared drug solution. While chloroquine-resistant strains may already exist in Cameroon, the present study suggests that they would be restricted to a limited area and are not widespread. Data also suggest that monitoring of the sensitivity of P. falciparum to quinine might soon be necessary.},
